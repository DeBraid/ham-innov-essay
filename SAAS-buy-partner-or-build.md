Buy, partner or build.

Maybe we don't need to do this... is the common threat.

When a company decides to buy: they are accelerating time and traction. 

So they can buy any vendor, or 1 specific target.

2 types of M&A 

CEO-level: 
-- I want to win long term, 5-10 years...  Blockbuster / unicorn prices 
-- will use shares, cash, whatever.  Sexy company X must be ours at all costs... (Facebook buys WhatsApp)

SVP level: 
-- More about making a sales plan.  More nickel and dime.  
-- motivated by immediate self-preservation, generally filling holes.  Lots of 8-9 figure M&A.
