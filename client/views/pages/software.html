        <p>Company-as-application-provider might sound abstract, but it's more familiar than first appears: serve the end-users -- your valued customers -- with unqiue, tailored, individualized functionality that constantly evolves in real time as new products and services roll out.

        <p>A quarter of the jobs — from analysts to entrepreneurs and CEOs — are as much about business as technology. Others combine information technology with life science, security, analytics, marketing, gaming, art and design — you name it. Students, parents, teachers and the public at large need to hear this new narrative.</p>

        <p>A: "We'll consider funding you, but your chances are about <strong>10x better</strong> if you find yourself a technical cofounder."</p>

IDC themselves describes technology in 2014: 

"2014 will be all about pitched battles all across the 3rd Platform: in mobile devices and platforms, in cloud services, in Big Data and social technologies, in the datacenters that will support the 3rd Platform, in a new generation of industry-transforming killer solutions." www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=244606

"the prediction echoes the well-known 2011 Marc Andreessen WSJ editorial that proclaimed that software is eating the world. He noted how Amazon, Netflix and Pandora upended the retail, video and music industries by operating, at their heart, as software-based companies.
