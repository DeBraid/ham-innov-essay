  <p>Global sales of TV sets, Personal Computer, smartphones, tablets, and video consoles over $750B (USD), almost double 2007. http://www.itworldcanada.com/blog/technology-predictions-for-the-coming-year/98336#ixzz3HHCysjDM </p> 

  <p>Population of Hamilton is roughly 500,000 people, an amount that barely exceeds the number of Canadians currently working in Silicon Valley (350,000).  A global market for talent, people vote with their feet and wallets.  Forget SV, Hamilton has to compete with Toronto and Kitchener-Waterloo (KW).  Even Buffalo attracting tech talent with $5 million start up competition[ref].</p>

  <p>Hamilton has survived one of it's principal employers (Stelco, now US Steel) reducing their labour force by 90%. Nearly 25,000 jobs lost since peak in 1981 (26,263 to 9,700 in 2004 — when the company entered creditor protection — to just over 2,300 in 2014).  Their four main pension plans are underfunded by $1.2 billion.

  <p>Hamilton was a community built on steel, the legacy of previous entrepreneurs is the ecosystem of custom metal fabricators and steel processing innovators.  Clustering of industry is a priority of city planners as the synergy achieved can produce major economic benefits.</p>

  <p>Among the most significant priorities for an city should be the establishment of technology community.  Conditions for start-ups or entrepreneurship. Students and entrepreneurs are indebted and insecure about their futures, so they are risk averse.  Investors are also risk averse, utilizing their capital in more traditional investments like mutual funds and real estate.  Investors need to consider risk in terms of the future and not the past.</p>

  <p>Steel as its bread and butter for a century(?), and will soon close it's doors permanently.  Their plight is significant, but these are not job of the future, nor should they be a priority for innovative and forward thinking city leaders.  They are dozens of existing government programs to assist those transitioning careers, let them do their jobs.  If you feel required to intervene because the existing welfare and retraining apparatus is insufficient to help these people, then all of the existing programs should immediately be terminated, with the funds used for their former operations being diverted into the unemployment pool.

    <p>Nascent strength in housing and persistent leadership in health care and education make up the Industry.  Manufacturing has been reduced to third fiddle, surpassed by FIRE and Ed's and Med's.

  ## Start Up Culture

 ## Digital Entrepreneurship 

  There are no easy ways to make money online, but there many ways to try.

  Hamilton has many successful and thriving digital businesses.  Many of these firms are agencies with wonderful job creators who collaborate with SMBs.  The presence fo these digital professionals and their recent growth suggests an early trend that could use a nudge. 

  Hamilton has not seen large investments in technology, specifically software development and start ups, ever.  Certainly not on the magnitude of Toronto and Waterloo, even when adjusted for population and other factors.  Venture capital, and the large scale private investors in Hamilton have demonstrated a markedly more risk averse tendencies. {foo}

There is capital plenty of capital in Hamilton.  All capital is scare, and technology is not the only problem to be solved.  The issue with lack of innovation in Hamilton is simple: 

--limited supply of financial capital is invested in low-risk, low-reward projects and ventures. 

Real estate, education and health care dominate the capital flow.  Child and Youth development.  This absence of speculative capital funding entrepreneurial activities is a critical bottleneck for innovation. </p>

<h4>Hamilton has a major capital misallocation problem.</h4>
