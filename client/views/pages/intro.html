  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
  <p>Population of Hamilton is roughly 500,000 people, an amount that barely exceeds the number of Canadians currently working in Silicon Valley (350,000).  A global market for talent, people vote with their feet and wallets.  Forget SV, Hamilton has to compete with Toronto and Kitchener-Waterloo (KW).  Even Buffalo attracting tech talent with $5 million start up competition[ref].</p>

  <p>Hamilton has survived one of it's principal employers (Stelco, now US Steel) reducing their labour force by 90%. Aprox 25,000 jobs lost since peak 1981 (26,263 to 9,700 in 2004 — when the company entered creditor protection — to just over 2,300 in 2014).  Their four main pension plans are underfunded by $1.2 billion.

  <p>Hamilton was a community whose bread and butter was making steel raw steel, and entrepreneurs of years passed formed an ecosystem around them: transportation, custom metal fab, storage and processing innovations.  We cannot make light of the decline of steel in Hamilton since many businesses continue to thrive in this environment with geographically diverse and prudent operations.  The people work hard and many great Canadians operate global businesses with priorities in Hamilton.</p>

  <p>But there are many ways this city can improve. The tech community is behind neighboring cities.  Conditions are not ripe for start ups or entrepreneurship. Students and entrepreneurs are indebted and insecure about their futures, so they are risk averse.  Investors are also risk averse, utilizing their capital in more traditional investments like mutual funds and real estate.  Investors need to consider risk in terms of the future and not the past.</p>

  <p>Steel as its bread and butter for a century(?), and will soon close it's doors permanently.  Their plight is significant, but these are not job of the future, nor should they be a priority for innovative and forward thinking city leaders.  They are dozens of existing government programs to assist those transitioning careers, let them do their jobs.  If you feel required to intervene because the existing welfare and retraining apparatus is insufficient to help these people, then all of the existing programs should immediately be terminated, with the funds used for their former operations being diverted into the unemployment pool.

    <p>Nascent strength in housing and persistent leadership in health care and education make up the Industry.  Manufacturing has been reduced to third fiddle, surpassed by FIRE and Ed's and Med's.
