The Canadian market is on the other end of the spectrum. Fundraising by Canadian VCs has been down since 2012, though partly due to slower than expected deployment of VCAP. Canadian firms raised $1.2B, down 30%, in 2014 according to ThomsonReuters, a level equal to the U.S. in 1980 (this is why I am bullish on Canadian Tech & VC but a topic for a longer discussion). While the amount of investing by VCs has increased to $2.4B in 2014, up 21%, it pales in comparison to the U.S. increase of 61%. Capital overhang is likely less than a year across Canada; the situation is critically worse in BC. Basically, in aggregate, the Canadian VC market lives paycheck to paycheck â€“ raising money that is consumed that year. betakit.com/its-a-tech-bubble-or-is-it/
