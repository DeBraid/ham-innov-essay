	<h4> MIT experts in their global work on innovation districts found tremendous success using strategic visions, which are more nimble in scope than traditional master plans.</h4>
	<p>
		Updating conventional rules still found in many inward-focused research institutions and organizations to encourage spin-offs, dual-career researchers and avoiding pitfalls like universities producing innovations and manpower that are irrelevant to local industry.
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to reach critical mass of knowledge commercializing and innovation, local firms are required to succeed in their commercialization efforts at a large scale.   Organic growth from private sector firms has shown to proliferate and sustain only after critical mass was obtained.  Until this occurs, regulations and business conditions should be as free as need to ensure the new technology can sustain itself and reach the industry-specific applications it seeks.  This is the role of venture capital: the runway. 
	</p>

	<h4>Marc Andressen summarizes the recipe for innovation clusters as follows: <a href="a16z.com/2014/06/20/what-it-will-take-to-create-the-next-great-silicon-valleys-plural/" target="_blank">ref</a></h4>

	<p>
		Creating the “next” Silicon Valley goes something like this: 
		<ul>
			<li>Build a big, beautiful, fully equipped technology park;</li>
			<li>Mix in R&D labs and university centers;</li>
			<li>Provide incentives to attract scientists, firms, and users;</li>
			<li>Interconnect the industry through consortia and specialized suppliers;</li>
			<li>Protect intellectual property and tech transfer; and</li>
			<li>Establish a favorable business environment and regulations.</li>
		</ul>		
	</p> 
	<blockquote>
		The results on this approach are mixed.
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		  Efforts from government alone are insufficient.  Networks are important. Andressen suggests that creating the next Silicon Valley should not be the goal, but more 'X' Valleys, where 'X' is "biotech, medical devices, stem cells, drones, autonomous cars, robots, nanotech, fin svcs, etc."<a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/426587326861430785" target="_blank">ref</a>.  Figuring out what domain is specific to the region: what industry is nearby, where are the potential synergies? Can we remove regulatory hurdles for that particular domain?
	</p>
	<h4>Cities/states/countries can encourage or legalize different kinds of innovation suited to their specific strengths.  the focus is more on driving regulatory competition between city, state, and national governments.</h4>
	<p>It’s already happening in places like Brazil (commercial drone-regulation friendly), with genetic reporting companies like 23andme are forced to explore opportunities outside the US, athletes like Kobe Bryant and others who go to Germany for biologic medicine, and Japan (slashing regulatory red tape to attract more drug R&D).</p>

	<p>How to recreate Silicon Valley? Don't. <a href="www.technologyreview.com/news/516506/silicon-valley-cant-be-copied/" target="_blank">By Vivek Wadhwa on July 3, 2013</a></p>

		Terman, sometimes called the “father of Silicon Valley,” had turned Stanford’s fledgling engineering school into an innovation engine. By encouraging science and engineering departments to work together, linking them to local firms, and focusing research on the needs of industry, he created a culture of coöperation and information exchange that has since defined the region.
	</p>
	<p>
		Despite common needs, companies would not work with competitors.  Terman would later try again in Dallas. But he failed for similar reasons.  It wasn’t academia, industry, or even the U.S. government’s funding for military research into aerospace and electronics that had created Silicon Valley: it was the people and the relationships that Terman had so carefully fostered among Stanford faculty and industry leaders.

	<h4>We know that success begets success in venture capital: The elite evaluator story.</h4>
	<p>
		Evaluators vary in the perceived average quality of the applicants they endorse. So applicants seek the highest ranked evaluator willing to endorse them. To keep their reputation, evaluators can’t consistently lie about the quality of those they evaluate. But evaluators can charge a price for their evaluations, and higher ranked evaluators can charge more. So evaluators who, for whatever reason, end up with a better pool of applicants can sustain that advantage and extract continued rents from it. This is a concrete plausible story to explain the continued advantage of top schools, journals, and venture capitalists. On reflection, it is also a nice concrete story to help explain who resists prediction markets and why. For example, within each organization, some “elites” are more respected and sought after as endorsers of organization projects. The better projects look first to get endorsement of elites, allowing those elites to sustain a consistently higher quality of projects that they endorse. And to extract higher rents from those who apply to them. If such an organization were instead to use prediction markets to rate projects, elite evaluators would lose such rents. So such elites naturally oppose prediction markets. <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2015/05/elite-evaluator-rents.html#sthash.t1HiQJmY.dpuf www.overcomingbias.com/2015/05/elite-evaluator-rents.html" target="_blank">ref</a>

		Development of technical skills takes place within formal education <strong>and</strong> training institutions. Within firms and R&D institutions the technical knowledge is spread actively by doing.  Real industry experience is an important hurdle.

	<h4>is there really a recipe, if it can't be repeated?</h4>
	<h4>What about serial entrepreneurs? (see talent section, where power law determines outcomes)</h4>
	<p>
		Better technology and more venture capital have created a class of labour known colliqually as the seriel entrepensuer.  Wh
	</p>
	<h4>what about age?</h4>
	<h4>Mckinsey study: since 1980, 3000 software businesses</h4>
	<p>
		Mckinsey analyzed the life cycles of about 3000 software and online-services companies from around the globe between 1980 and 2012.  They found growth trumps all, sustaining growth is hard, but there is a recipe. 	
		<a href="www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/grow_fast_or_die_slow" target="_blank">ref</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		Classical theory suggests only 2 sources, growth and return on invested capital, can create value.  In software growth in the early stages of a company’s is most important.  High growth companies return more to shareholders, (5x medium-growth co's), and are more likely to attain long-term success.
	</p>
	<p>
		Very few companies have make it big! In software and Internet-services database of ~3000 companies <strong>Mckinsey found 28% reached $100 million in revenue, while only 3% reached $1 billion</strong>.  Finally, only 17 achieved $4 billion in revenue as independent companies, the unicorns.
	</p>
	<p>
		Four principles are essential to sustaining growth "from which every company can benefit" according to the consulting firm.  The formula is broken down into growth phases of company and the requisite activities.  Five critical enablers of growth: 
		<ul>
		 	<li>product-market fit</li>
		 	<li>monetization model</li>
		 	<li>rapid adoption</li>
		 	<li>stealth</li>
		 	<li>incentives</li>
		 </ul>
	</p>
	<h4>Importance of sustaining momentum in sales: harnessing episodic growth</h4>
	<p>
		Stagnate growth rates are known as the "Humpty Dumpty" problem: even a short stint of lower growth had dramatic long-term consequences.  Of the companies that grow to $100 million in sales and then experience a lull in sales only, only 1/2 right the ship and regain their former success.  Humpty dumpty will kill half of all successful start ups!
	</p>
	<p>
		Thus alignment of culture and incentives are critical for many start-ups.  Companies and their <strong>executives should be focused on building $1 billion companies, in as short a time period as possible</strong>.  Create a product or service that con quickly obtain monopoly status in a small, but rapidly expanding market.
	</p>
	<h4>Size matters</h4>
	<p>
		Between $100 million and $1 billion in annual revenues many companies find themselves constrained by natural market-size or market-share limits.  What relevance this has to Canadian startups.
