		Innovation is non linear.  The best way to show this is the curve of innovation (Moores Law, and Kurzweils version that goes back 110 years). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPgyb6euISs">ref</a>

	<p>
		Fascinatingly innovation continues without regard to wars, famine, economic booms and busts. It grows faster than exponential growth!  Reids Law creates a combinatorial explosion of possiblities.  The number of ideas is compounding which gives an expanding lift to technological innovation.  It's not slowing with maturation, but speeding up.

		In Canada, BDC/Nielsen survey was conducted of 1,139 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  Findings echo, in part, those published by Statistics Canada 20 years ago, which revealed innovation to be the single most important factor that led to business success. <a href="www.bdc.ca/EN/Documents/analysis_research/five-dos-and-five-donts.pdf" target="_blank">ref</a>

		 Concretely, 7 of 10 most successful businesses reported that they were either first adopters or early adopters of new technology (vs half of all others)
	</p>
	<p>
		Virtually all new jobs are generated by firms with 20 or fewer employees.  Growth lies in small innovation businesses.  How do we create those?
