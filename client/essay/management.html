	<h4>
		Most management books describe peacetime CEO techniques while very few describe wartime.

		Ben Horowitz suggests that know when and how to toggle between these varying states is critical for leaders in tech. <a href="www.bhorowitz.com/peacetime_ceo_wartime_ceo" target="_blank">ref</a>

	<p>
		Peacetime CEO knows that proper protocol leads to winning.  As a result, leaders encourage broad-based creativity and contribution across a diverse set of possible objectives. 
		<blockquote>
			Leaders must maximize and broaden the current opportunity in peacetime.
		</blockquote> 

		The company’s survival in wartime depends upon strict adherence and alignment to the mission. Wartime CEO violates protocol in order to win.
		<blockquote>
			Wartime CEOs typically has a single bullet in the chamber and must, at all costs, hit the target.
		</blockquote>

	<p>
		The initial Steve Jobs turnaround of Apple a great example of wartime tactics.  The company was weeks from going under, and everyone needed to get aboard and strictly follow the marching orders from Jobs.
	</p>
	<p>
		In contrast, the dominance of Google throughout the 2000's lead to 20% time and creative exercises that led to innovation.
	</p>
	<p>
		When times are good, leadership can adopt a nurturing posture and empower the team to make detailed decisions.  Conversely, during wartime CEOs should be ruthlessly detail oriented and do whatever it takes to keep everyone focused on the primary goal.
