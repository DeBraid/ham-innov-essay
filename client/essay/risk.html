    <h2>Risk in Start Ups</h2>
    <p>Enumerated by the venerable practitioner Marc Andressen in 2007 <a href="pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part2.html" target="_blank">ref</a>.
    </p>
    <li>Founder risk: does the startup have proper founding team? A great technologist, plus someone who can run the company make a solid founding team.</li>
    </p>
    <li>Market risk: is there a market for the product (using the term product and service interchangeably)? Will anyone want it? Will they pay for it? How much will they pay? How do we know? </p>

    </li>
    <li>Competition risk: are there too many other startups already doing this? Is this startup sufficiently differentiated from the other startups, and also differentiated from any large incumbents? </p>

    </li>
    <li>Timing risk: is it too early? Is it too late? </p>

    </li>
    <li>Financing risk: after we invest in this round, how many additional rounds of financing will be required for the company to become profitable, and what will the dollar total be? How certain are we about these estimates? How do we know? </p>

    </li>
    <li>Marketing risk: will this startup be able to cut through the noise? How much will marketing cost? Do the economics of customer acquisition -- the cost to acquire a customer, and the revenue that customer will generate -- work? </p>

    </li>
    <li>Distribution risk: does this startup need certain distribution partners to succeed? Will it be able to get them? How? (For example, this is a common problem with mobile startups that need deals with major mobile carriers to succeed.) </p>

    </li>
    <li>Technology risk: can the product be built? Does it involve rocket science -- or an equivalent, like artificial intelligence or natural language processing? Are there fundamental breakthroughs that need to happen? If so, how certain are we that they will happen, or that this team will be able to make them? </p>

    </li>
    <li>Product risk: even assuming the product can in theory be built, can this team build it? </p>

    </li>
    <li>Hiring risk: what positions does the startup need to hire for in order to execute its plan? E.g. a startup planning to build a high-scale web service will need a VP of Operations -- will the founding team be able to hire a good one? </p>

    </li>
    <li>Location risk: where is the startup located? Can it hire the right talent in that location? And will I as the VC need to drive more than 20 minutes in my Mercedes SLR McLaren to get there? </p>

    </li>
