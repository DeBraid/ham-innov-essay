	<h2>Age and the Entrepreneur</h2>
	
	<p>## Stats and Info on VC Industry via Chamath Palihapitiya of Social+Capital on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncjum-bkW98&amp;ab_channel=StartupGrind">Startup Grind</a> Oct 2015.  Related <a href="https://twitter.com/Royal_Arse/status/670241427947986944">tweetstorm</a>.</p>

	<p>When Chamath started his VC firm, they crunched a bunch of data on previous investment returns in venture capital (studied data 1985-present, all major exits not including current unicorns A and B rounds only.  With later-stage investing, age less important (<em>presumably since fundamentals matter much more as a company grows</em>). </p>

	<p>Of those exits that returned money to its investing partners, there was a strong correlation between age and returns. </p>

	<blockquote>
	  <p>Age of 36-47yo correlated with positively with returns.  </p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>If you add the modern unicorns back in (which presumably have not exited), lower bound goes down to 33-34yo.</p>

	<p>Given correlation of venture returns with the age of the investor, it clear technology investment absolutely lends itself to youth.  Fascinatingly this applies only to early-stage investments: small companies with much greater uncertainty. </p>

	<p>My guess would be that network effects (being in the know on key technical areas) and risk aversion (which expands with age) both contribute to this phenomena.</p>

	<blockquote>
	  <p>Second major takeaway: diversity matters. </p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The greater consensus among the group of investors, the worse they did. </p>

	<blockquote>
	  <p>Third key: Define your values. <em>Literally write them down.</em></p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>It's difficult to build something when you don't know your true character.  Has negative impact on hiring. </p>

	<p>By writing down the core values, use them to evaluate the people your hire.  </p>

	<blockquote>
	  <p>Basically hire the people who roughly agree with you, and share the same values, so the when the chips are down they won't run away.</p>
	</blockquote>




	<p>Professor of psychology at Cal (UC Davis) Dean Simonton has conducted research on age and creativity across many fields, including science, literature, music, chess, film, politics, and military combat. A summary of his research is presented by <a href="http://pmarchive.com/age_and_the_entrepreneur.html" target="_blank">here</a></p>
	<p>
		The important questions that Simonton tried to answer: 
		<blockquote>
			Is there an optimal age for a person to make a lasting contribution to human culture or society? 
		</blockquote>
		Putting the discipline or task aside the research aims to make some generalizations about age and ability.
		<blockquote>
			When during the life span can we expect an individual to be most prolific or influential?
		</blockquote>
		Focus on real life achievements rather than performances, which would skew the results towards sciences, business (products, things more easily quantified) and away from arts.
	</p>
	<p>
		Dr. Simonton finds creative output as a function of age that productivity will rise rapidly to a peak, at which point it will decline about 50%, without regard to domain.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Domain tends to impact the magnitiude of the peak and whence it occurs.  Early peaks (20s/30s) are observed in fields like poetry, math, physics, while more elongated curves appear for novelists, philosophers, medicine and general scholarship.
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		It must be stressed that these interdisciplinary contrasts do not appear to be arbitrary but instead have been shown to be invariant across different cultures and distinct historical periods.
	</blockquote>
	<p>
		Distribution of output is predictably a power law.  A small percentage of the workers in any given domain is responsible for the bulk of the work. Top 10% of the most prolific elite can be credited with around 50% of all contributions.  Bottom 50% of workers perform ~15% of total work.   Simonton likely seeded the concept of 10x-100x programmers with conclusions like: 
		<blockquote>
			The most productive contributor is usually about 100 times more prolific than the least.
		</blockquote>
	</p>
	<h4>Early and often: how does this impact founders?</h4>
	<p>
		Those who generate the most contributions overall tend to have begun their careers at earlier, ended their careers at later, and produced at extraordinary rates <strong>throughout</strong> their careers.
	</p>
	<h4>More swings at the plate</h4>
	<p>
		Large and small achievements fluctuate together.  Periods in a creator's life that see the most masterpieces also witness the greatest number of easily forgotten productions, on the average.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the quality of output does not vary with age, then how old are the best entrepreneurs? The odds of a hit versus a miss do not increase over time. A period with many hits will also likely have many misses.
		<blockquote>
			So maximizing quantity -- taking more swings at the bat -- is much higher payoff than trying to improve one's batting average.
		</blockquote> 
		Intelligence, about a certain threshold, at least as measured by metrics such as IQ, is largely irrelevant for output and entrepreneurs.
