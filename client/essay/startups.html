    <p>Good news: even playing field. Older and younger entrepreneurs both exhibit qualities needed. Much easier ways to get rich than a start up. It's a wildly stressful and consuming experience, which attributes to the failure rate.</p>

    <p>Ideas are worthless. Execution is much more important than ideas, but good ideas are critical. Terrible ideas are diseases. Most great companies start with great ideas, not a pivot. </p>

    <p>Ideas - size and girth of market, grow and potential, moats and other concerns. It's a 10 year progress. Planning is a health process for businesses.</p>

    <p><b>Need to build a business that is difficult to replicate.  Idea first, then explore the market.</b></p>

    <p>Best companies are mission oriented. Steve Jobs motivated Apple employees with intense presence and dedication to his ideas. He often was wildly emotional -- sad, angry, happy -- and drove the culture along with him, dead or alive. There were many bodies. But the success in mission-driven organizations is proven.</p>

    <blockquote>Best ideas often look terrible at first. If and idea sounds really good, there are too many people already exploring it. Most people will think your great idea is bad. Conviction in your own beliefs and willingness to ignore what others are saying.</blockquote>

    <p>Most people will think your great idea is bad. Truly good ideas don't sound like they're worth stealing. Be happy, since that means people wont compete with you. It's not really dangerous.</p>

    <p>Idea doesnt need to sound really big. It needs to take over a small specific market. Look to the size of the market in the future, not right now! How will the market evolve?</p>

    <p>The growth of the market is the reason to invest. A small, rapidly growing market is fertile ground for multiplication of capital. Small markets, means undeserved, and potential customers will tolerate a product that solves a problem, and is rapidly improving over time.</p>

    <h4>Seqouia Capital on what makes a good idea? </h4>

    <blockquote>Why now? Why was 2 years ago too early, and two years from now too late? </blockquote>

    <p>Motivation: build something that you yourself need. This is why start up founders often come from academia. They need to create tools for themselves first. Why universities are ventures of innovation. </p>

    <p>Recreating the atmosphere of academia in start ups has been done. Incubators and accelerators achieve this with nominal funding and equity. </p>

    <h4>CHICAGO</h4>


    <p>
        19 Chicago-based companies achieved exits totaling over $3 billion in 2013. Last year, 271 digital startups launched in Chicago, 78 of which raised in > $1 million in capital. In 2014, venture funding up 128% (first half) and 6 companies exiting for over $2 billion in aggregate." <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/accelerators/2014/09/19/george-deeb-the-next-big-startup-ecosystem/" target="_blank">ref</a>

        <li>Angel Investors -- is there capital flowing to high risk businesses with large market opportunity?</li>
        <li>Networks of angel investors formed incubators, accelorators, etc, and shared start-up spaces.</li>
        <li>Significant exits. Cashing out, spreading the wealth (or at least some) within the ecosystem.</li>
        <li>Large companies embrace innovation and began collaboration w/ local ent's.</li>
        <li>Local universities and colleges bulk up & modernize their tech infrastructure.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Armed with financial capital Angel investors organized themselves into networks, incubators, accelerators and shared startup office spaces popped up. Substantial exits were achieved by startups like Groupon, GrubHub and Braintree, creating a bunch of new entrepreneurs, mentors and angel investors in their wake. Large Illinois-based companies like Walgreens, Motorola, Blue Cross and Allstate started to embrace innovation and began collaborating with local entrepreneurs." (-- bring out the angelist chart!

        <blockquote>
            ]"That's the thing about counterintuitive ideas, they contradict your intuitions, they seem wrong, so of course your first impulse is to ignore them and, in fact, that's not just the curse of Y Combinator, but to some extent our raison d'être. You don't need people to give you advice that does not surprise you. If founders' existing intuition gave them the right answers, they would not need us. That's why there are a lot of ski instructors, and not many running instructors; you don't see those words together, "running instructor," as much as you see "ski instructor." It's because skiing is counterintuitive, sort of what YC is--business ski instructors--except you are going up slopes instead of down them, well ideally."

        We have a deficit when it comes to comprehension of non-linear problems. Ebola is a perfect example. A horrific disease that kills over 50% of those infected, taken nearly 3000 lives already (Fall 2014), expected to kill 25k-150k. Yet experts have characterized the global health movement as 'glacial' and completely inadequate. We aren't adept at perceiving scale in non-linear distributions or curves.

    <p>This, plus the loss aversion principal, drives investment in rust belt cities and jurisdictions that invest like its 1990. Old and safe.</p>
