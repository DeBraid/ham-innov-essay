  <h5>Demand for Labour: Local and Global</h5>

  <p>In less than 3 years Canada will be short over 100,000 full time tech jobs.  Quality jobs with high wages and growth potential will go unfilled as the supply of talent sags, while <strong>only 1 in 10 organizations can meet critical IT needs in mobile, cloud computing, analytics and social media</strong>, according <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/2013/07/10/why-canada-is-failing-at-tech/?__lsa=7bd0-dc52">to IBM study.</a></p>

  <p>The Information and Communications Technology Council (ICT), an independent policy advisor for the tech sector, has warned of <strong>“serious and pervasive”</strong> recruitment challenges in the years ahead.  Suggest 106,000 jobs shortage, offer the following solutions: </p>

  <ul>
    <li>encourage more post-secondary students to take ICT-related courses, </li>
    <li>integrating foreign-educated workers into Canada’s ICT workforce, </li>
    <li>shifting post-secondary curriculum towards more cross-disciplinary programs, </li>
    <li>getting the industry itself to accept compromises on skill levels </li>
    <li>embracing more diversity in the ICT workforce.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>How hard is it to find 100,000 qualified people? In US approximately 40,000 students earn bachelor’s degrees in computer science per year.  Using rule-of-thumb 1/10th reduction to account for population, that means Canada graduates ~4000 per year.  Anecdotes from Hamilton have estimates at fewer than 150-200 competent grads produced by McMaster and Mohawk per annum, suggesting that 4000 graduates per year might be on the high end.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    “Employers are on the hunt for personnel who have specific combinations of ICT experience as well as expertise in domains such as e-health, e-finance and digital media. In the next five years, Canada is going to see a new, radically different ICT job market emerge.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>Stacking an optimistic projection for 12,000-15,000 new Canadian grads by 2016 against 100,000 job openings is miserable.  Size of <strong>missed opportunity is 4x that which we've seized</strong>.  Canadian skilled-labour shortage will at best cause +80% of economic potential left on the table.  Given firms already struggle to fill entry-level engineers and developers, the demand for tech jobs will likely be greater than 100,000.</p>

  <h3>Academia and Venture Capital</h3>
  <p>Many of the most successful companies have been associated with have their foundations in academia, so much so that prominent VC firm a16z has a <a href="a16z.com/2014/09/25/on-dark-talent-moocs-universities-and-startups-an-interview-with-andreessen-horowitz-first-distinguished-visiting-professor-of-computer-science/">professor-in-residence role.</a> </p>

  { why are masters and phds likely to start successful start ups? }

  <p>Niche element to laboratory or grad studies leads smart firms to actively recruit professors or graduate students in a CS or STEM discipline with the purpose of commercializing their research.  The process of getting from “bench to bedside” (to borrow a term from academic biomedicine) is hardly a process at all, even at elite institutions like Stanford (or the University of Waterloo). </p>

  <p>Schools like Stanford and Waterloo have founding principles that are rooted in engineering, medicine, mathematics and more applied areas, the clustering of tech around these firms is not random.</p>
  
  <h4>Keys to commercializing academia</h4> 
  <ol>
    <li>Bottom up research design.</li>
    <li>Faculty has 1 day per week for non-school business</li>
    <li>Students think about entrepreneurship from Day 1</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Bottom-up allows crazy ideas, or ideas outside the mainstream, which provide a real solution can bubble up much more easily.  At Stanford, faculty can serve 1 day a week at non-Stanford work.  Often this take the form of partnering with start ups, frequently those of former students (the students are day-to-day, the professor’s there one day a week).  Students are always thinking about it as the work is going on, they’re thinking in real time about what would work.</p>

  <h4>Waterloo & Buffalo: Competition for Talent, Risk and Money</h4>
  <p>

  Back to Waterloo Communitech 

  More than 450 start-ups opened for business in the twin cities of Waterloo and Kitchener last year, more than four times the number begun in 2009. 

  In the year ended April 30, 2013, more than C$214 million ($235 million) was invested in start-ups in the Kitchener-Waterloo area.  Three years earlier, the figure was just $500,000, according to Communitech.

  The Canadian government has also backed C$200 million ($183 million)-plus fund to indirectly invest in and support early and mid-stage start-ups.

  In 1997, Communitech is Waterloo Region’s hub for the commercialization of innovative technologies. Over the years, we have supported and helped build a tech cluster of nearly 1,000 companies that now generates more than $30 billion in revenue.

  Risk capital dives innovation.  Silcon Valley, Toronto, Seattle, Vancouver, Austin, New York, Chicago, and Boston et al have risk capital that flows to ent's.

  Waterloo has risk capital and talent. 

  Y Combinator President/CE) Sam Altman on Waterloo: 
  "We look at it as one of the most important talent pools and sources for startups that we fund".  Described it as one of the few cities in the world they prioritize, and maintain very active presence outside of SV.  It's "such a high-density pool of talent".

  Turned heads with these comments, adding: "I would take the long side of a population-adjusted prop bet that a $10B company emerges from Waterloo before NYC.  Waterloo is the most impressive up-and-coming startup city I've been to."

  Waterloo does not suffer from the same mental block as Hamilton WRT technology.  They have witnessed first hand the impacts of successful start-ups growing into mega-employer and providing jobs and prosperity for entire ecosystem. 

  VC firms consider themselves to be doing well if 4 out of 10 companies they fund succeed.  This type of attitude towards success and failure is not common in society, and especially not in Hamilton where investors overwhelimingly prefer 'safe' securities over 'risky' ones.


  Technology is viewed as the safe bet.  In Hamilton, its eds and meds.  These industries are the last frontiers for technological disruption.  They create the biggest opportunity and thus the greatest challenge for Hamilton.

  Where is the venture capital in Hamilton?  Where is the tech ecosystem?  How can we improve this?

  ## Incentives and Soltions
  -- regular hackathons.  Cash prizes for first, second and third.  Give people with technical skills a chance to come to Hamilton to show off their chops.  Solve big problems that most people investors ignore: like MIT hosting a breast-pump hackathon.  http://www.fastcoexist.com/3035758/a-reinvented-breast-pump-needs-to-be-just-the-first-step-in-changing-pumping-norms

  If we don't give technically skilled people a reason to come to Hamilton (hint: it's money aka jobs, since we all know this is a great livable city!).  If we don't provide capital to start ups then they'll go to Toronto where they have a chance.  Or Buffalo, which recently annouced one of the largest start up competitions ever, with $5million in funding, and a place to work.  Check out http://www.43north.org/about-43north to see how allocating capital to risky ventures can change a rust-belt city.  (43North is part of NY Cuomo’s Buffalo Billion initiative, which is driving new economic opportunities throughout Buffalo and Western New York. http://www.cusli.org/2014Conference/PastConferences/2013Conference/SupportingArticles/tabid/205/FileId/593/Default.aspx )
  Steve Poland has been selected as managing director of Z80 Labs, with $1.5 million in new funding (total $6.6 million) for incubator in Buffalo. www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2015/01/06/z80-taps-poland-as-managing-director-adds-1-5m-in.html

  Hamilton is competing for talent that currently has better opportunities and tech ecosytem in Waterloo, Toronto, and Buffalo.  This is a major challenge for the city, but it has a clear solution: 
  </p>
  <h4>Dedicate efforts to attract, retain and grow talent</h4>
  <p>
    Ability to attract, retain, and grow talent "plays a valuable role in differentiating seemingly identical clusters" across the globe.  Every business and region is fiercely competeing to hire the best people. To lure individuals trained or educated in specific niches and specializations is vital to optimizing an innovation cluster.
  </p>
  <p>
    Barcelona (Spain), Eindhoven (Netherlands), London, Silicon Valley many others making target international professionals as stimulants for local economic activity.  
  </p>
  <p>
    IN US, South Lake Union’s most successful attraction strategy was to entice Amazon to move to the area. As one entrepreneur said: “We love being next to Amazon” They are to South Lake Union and Seattle what Microsoft was to Redmond and the Eastside in the 1990s. They attract a lot of talent. Talent begets talent.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Retention of recent university graduates is equally important, a renewing source of human capital. Growing talent, means greater entrepreneurial capacity, more entropy in the ecosystem of start-ups and spin-offs dedicated to commercializing ideas. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Expanding the talent pool means developing a feeder system of STEM workers with the general and customized  technical skills necessary.<a href="www.brookings.edu/~/media/Programs/metro/Images/Innovation/InnovationDistricts1.pdf" target="_blank">ref</a>
  </p>

  <h4>Add the power law distribution of great talent, and we're facing an even greater challenge than most realize.</h4>
  <p>
    We revisit a long-held assumption in human resource management,organizational behavior, and industrial and organizational psychologythat individual performance follows a Gaussian (normal) distribution.We conducted 5 studies involving 198 samples including 633,263 re-searchers, entertainers, politicians, and amateur and professional ath-letes. 

    Results are remarkably consistent across industries, types of jobs,types of performance measures, and time frames and indicate that in-dividual performance is not normally distributed—instead, it followsa Paretian (power law) distribution. Assuming normality of individualperformance can lead to misspecified theories and misleading practices.Thus, our results have implications for all theories and applications thatdirectly or indirectly address the performance of individual workers in-cluding performance measurement and management, utility analysis inpreemployment testing and training and development, personnel selec-tion, leadership, and the prediction of performance, among others.
