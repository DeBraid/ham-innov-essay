		Warfare Demands Technology
	</h2>
	<p>
		The origins of Silicon Valley can be directly attributed to capital provision of the Allies.  The aforementioned Steve Blank provides an excellent hour-long talk about this history summarized below. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC_RxWN_xo" target="_blank">ref</a>

	<h4>Mission Driven</h4>
	<p>
		Much like the start ups of modern day, the best talent is often attracted to a mission they can identify with.  In the 1940's and 1950's the mission was clear: save the world from the Germans, and Soviets.
	</p>
	<p>
		Several men played integral roles.  Fred Terman and Robert Noyce and presented as the godfathers of Silicon Valley, each playing a distinct role.
	</p>
	<p>
		Terman was driven to save the World from destruction of warfare.  To do this, he broke the social code at the time and took radical action to poach smartest and brightest in technology (radio and microwaves then).  He pitched and converted professors, grad students and others to leave academia for practical, militaristic pursuits.   This was viewed at the time as heretical: academics did NOT leave academia, nor was it kosher for (grad) students to drop our and pursue 
		<blockquote>
			In 1949, the Russians tested their first nuke and the war in Korea when hot.  This lead to spook-work being conducted in new research lab.  Terman directs all of Stanfords resources at stopping the Soviets.
		</blockquote>
	</p>
	<p>
		Terman formulated a unique plan: let the professors do research, and allow others to focus on commercialization.  Researchers are/were too busy to start companies.  Experts could then conduct research as usual, but profits were encouraged through consultations with the practitioners making commercial tech products.  A win-win approach that continues to provide a tailwind at Standford, Caltech and elsewhere in the Valley.
	</p>

	<p>
		Terman poached 10 professors from Harvard Radio Lab (then, the best in the world) and moved them to California (specifically Stanford).

		By 1950, Stanford was MIT-of-the-West thanks to Terman, key technical staff he poached from academia and across US, and government (military-based) funding.
