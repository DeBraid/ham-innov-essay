WAR! 

MISSION DRIVEN! -- Terman was driven to save the US, and the World from destruction from warfare.  To do this, he broke the social code at the time and converted professors and grad students to start out on their own (heretical at time). 

Goal was to do research, and allow other people to start companies.  The experts can do the research and then consult with the practitioners making the tech products.

Terman poached 10 professors from Harvard Radio Lab (best in the world) and moved them to Stanford.  By 1950, Stanford was MIT of the West thanks to Terman, key staff poached from elsewhere, and government (military funding).

In 1949, the Russians tested their first nuke and the war in Korea when hot.  This lead to spook-work being conducted in new research lab.  Terman directs all of Stanfords resources at stopping the Soviets.
