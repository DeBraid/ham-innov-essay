Trends in Employment, Technology and Inequality 

Technology enables fewer people to produce more.  They middle class is not being destroyed by evil corporates fat cats, but the technology that makes traditional labour obsolete. 

Technology will also come after the tech jobs too (AI), but in the meantime your workforce needs to be technically-based.  These are the firms.  

Technology is killing the middle class, but saving the poor.  Abject poverty has been reduced by 75% over the past 20 years, and the rich are far richer.  

When considering inequality cannot isolate the middle class.  Consider the whole spectrum and how changes in the labour market influence income distribution

Vinod Kholsa:
"At a startup, you can be tricked into thinking you’re building a technology company, so you focus a lot on the product. But ultimately, you’re really building a team to build the product and then the company. 

ref: firstround.com/review/Keith-Rabois-on-the-role-of-a-COO-how-to-hire-and-why-transparency-matters/
from Keith Rabois on operating, regarding a barrel-and-ammunition approach. 

Hiring the Best — Barrels & Ammunition

"Getting leverage as an entrepreneur is all about hiring the right people. That sounds easy, but it’s actually really, really hard.

If you think about people, there are two categories of high-quality people: there is the ammunition, and then there are the barrels. You can add all the ammunition you want, but if you have only five barrels in your company, you can literally do only five things simultaneously. If you add one more barrel, you can now do six things simultaneously. If you add another one, you can do seven, and so on. Finding those barrels that you can shoot through — someone who can take an idea from conception to live and it’s almost perfect — are incredibly difficult to find. This kind of person can pull people with them. They can charge up the hill. They can motivate their team, and they can edit themselves autonomously. Whenever you find a barrel, you should hire them instantly, regardless of whether you have money for them or whether you have a role for them. Just close them. firstround.com/review/Keith-Rabois-on-the-role-of-a-COO-how-to-hire-and-why-transparency-matters/

"Over the past 30 years, venture capital has become a dominant force in the financing of innovative American companies. From Google to Intel to FedEx, companies supported by venture capital have profoundly changed the U.S. economy. Despite the young age of the venture capital industry, public companies with venture capital backing employ four million people and account for one-fifth of the market capitalization and 44% of the research and development spending of U.S. public companies. From research and development to employment to simple revenue, the companies funded by venture capital are a major part of the U.S. economy."

TAXES

Good read on taxes.  When I left RBC (2013), generally was preferred to earn dividends from a corp (for most small biz, or CCPCs) vs. salary.  Appears since 2014 that is no longer true in Ontario, straight salary wins (even at highest marginal tax rates, so those in lower income brackets stand to benefit even more from taking salary).

The table at the end is AMAZING, very dense, but essentially showcases the relative competitive advantage of doing business in a given province.

Canada's record of business sector productivity growth over the past decade has been abysmal compared to our own past and compared to almost all other advanced economies. Business investment in research and development, a key driver of productivity, is very low and falling in dollar terms and as a share of GDP, and the Conference Board of Canada has just reported that Canada rates an overall grade of D when judged by key indicators of an innovative economy. 

Our global market share is just 1.3% and falling, and we rank just nineteenth in the world, behind even Malaysia, Denmark, the Czech republic and tiny Singapore

I do believe that the role of government is to "get out of the way" and allow the private sector to allocate scarce resources in the most efficient manner. 

The analogy I like to use is a farmer's field. Government is to prepare the field for planting - clearing the field, removing weeds, laying irrigation systems, and spreading fertilizer (the latter is NOT a jab to politicians!). The role of the entrepreneur is to determine which seeds to choose, where to plant it, and ensuring it gets the right amount of sunlight and water to let it grow. www.omersventures.com/single-voice-startup-community.aspx

Lecture 5 - Competition is for Losers (Peter Thiel) https://youtu.be/5_0dVHMpJlo?list=PL5q_lef6zVkaTY_cT1k7qFNF2TidHCe-1 via @YouTube 

All happy families are alike, all unhappy families are suffering from something unique.

In business, the oppositite is true.  Successful companies are are unique, failures suffer from the same problems.

Focus on small, but growing markets.  The growth part ensures that the trend can last.  The size part relates to the market.  Large markets = competition. 

Be the last mover.  Most of the vale of these companies comes in the future.  DCF shows that most value exists in the future (since growth will expand sales, but the marginal cost of software is very low).

Because of the above, Silicon Valley wrongly over-values growth, undervalues durability.  A time dimension to all the characteristics of a successful business.

VC ecosystem in Canada is shit: http://www.kauffman.org/blogs/policy-dialogue/2015/september/insights-from-canada#.VgaEZdBbb-k.twitter

From 2015 Global Startup Ecosystem Ranking from Compass:
	“the findings aren’t as positive for Canada as they were in 2012. Toronto and Vancouver slid nearly 10 spots from #8 to #17 and #9 to #18, respectively. Canada’s top startup cities have developed and grown over three years, but just not as fast as New York, Austin, Bangalore, Singapore, or Chicago,” interpreted Lennox. In fact, Vancouver and Toronto are the startup ecosystems which made the biggest falls,

Canada launched in April 2013 a Start-up Visa Program and has been a struggle earn on.  In the first 20 months only 5 met the criteria, despite projects of 2750 visa per year! (To qualify, a foreign entrepreneur must secure a minimum investment from either a designated VC fund ($200k) or from a designated angel-investor group ($75k).)

It’s a sobering reminder just how far a city once labelled “Silicon Valley North” has fallen off the map as a tech hub. Fifteen years ago, at the height of the dot-com bubble, Canada’s capital was a global high-tech hot spot – the nerve centre of then-mighty Nortel Networks and headquarters of other high-fliers in the race to build the Internet’s global infrastructure, including JDS Uniphase and Newbridge Networks. High-tech employment in 2001 stood at almost 80,000 locally, by one estimate, double the level five years earlier, and venture capitalists plowed more than $1-billion into Ottawa tech companies. “The market was out of control, and we’ll never see [anything like it] again,” says Ottawa corporate lawyer Debbie Weinstein, who took many of Ottawa’s 1990s tech stars public.

History of Silicon Valley -- Steve Blank https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC_RxWN_xo

WAR! 

MISSION DRIVEN! -- Terman was driven to save the US, and the World from destruction from warfare.  To do this, he broke the social code at the time and converted professors and grad students to start out on their own (heretical at time). 

Goal was to do research, and allow other people to start companies.  The experts can do the research and then consult with the practitioners making the tech products.

Terman poached 10 professors from Harvard Radio Lab (best in the world) and moved them to Stanford.  By 1950, Stanford was MIT of the West thanks to Terman, key staff poached from elsewhere, and government (military funding).

In 1949, the Russians tested their first nuke and the war in Korea when hot.  This lead to spook-work being conducted in new research lab.  Terman directs all of Stanfords resources at stopping the Soviets.

Steve Blank on StartUps in Canada - http://news.communitech.ca/columns/more-pirates-fewer-bankers-steve-blanks-prescription-for-scale-up-funding-in-canada/

"what are the strengths of the local ecosystem? Is there anything unique about current industry or manufacturing or location or schools or government support? And then, how do you get a risk culture for both entrepreneurs and capital in place?"

At times, the risk-capital culture in Canada feels like talking to the Swiss National Bank.

Bingo: "Waterloo exploded with startups, not clear risk capital culture has scaled to match it."

"That’s the difference between a winning cluster and a stillborn one – are people with money stepping up, or are they going elsewhere?"

 It describes the role of the U.S. government in funding Silicon Valley. And they didn’t put $2 million a year; they probably put $200 million a year into Silicon Valley, for lots of other reasons that might surprise some of your readers.
