It’s a sobering reminder just how far a city once labelled “Silicon Valley North” has fallen off the map as a tech hub. Fifteen years ago, at the height of the dot-com bubble, Canada’s capital was a global high-tech hot spot – the nerve centre of then-mighty Nortel Networks and headquarters of other high-fliers in the race to build the Internet’s global infrastructure, including JDS Uniphase and Newbridge Networks. High-tech employment in 2001 stood at almost 80,000 locally, by one estimate, double the level five years earlier, and venture capitalists plowed more than $1-billion into Ottawa tech companies. “The market was out of control, and we’ll never see [anything like it] again,” says Ottawa corporate lawyer Debbie Weinstein, who took many of Ottawa’s 1990s tech stars public.

History of Silicon Valley -- Steve Blank https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC_RxWN_xo

WAR! 

MISSION DRIVEN! -- Terman was driven to save the US, and the World from destruction from warfare.  To do this, he broke the social code at the time and converted professors and grad students to start out on their own (heretical at time). 

Goal was to do research, and allow other people to start companies.  The experts can do the research and then consult with the practitioners making the tech products.

Terman poached 10 professors from Harvard Radio Lab (best in the world) and moved them to Stanford.  By 1950, Stanford was MIT of the West thanks to Terman, key staff poached from elsewhere, and government (military funding).

In 1949, the Russians tested their first nuke and the war in Korea when hot.  This lead to spook-work being conducted in new research lab.  Terman directs all of Stanfords resources at stopping the Soviets.

Steve Blank on StartUps in Canada - http://news.communitech.ca/columns/more-pirates-fewer-bankers-steve-blanks-prescription-for-scale-up-funding-in-canada/

"what are the strengths of the local ecosystem? Is there anything unique about current industry or manufacturing or location or schools or government support? And then, how do you get a risk culture for both entrepreneurs and capital in place?"

At times, the risk-capital culture in Canada feels like talking to the Swiss National Bank.

Bingo: "Waterloo exploded with startups, not clear risk capital culture has scaled to match it."

"That’s the difference between a winning cluster and a stillborn one – are people with money stepping up, or are they going elsewhere?"

 It describes the role of the U.S. government in funding Silicon Valley. And they didn’t put $2 million a year; they probably put $200 million a year into Silicon Valley, for lots of other reasons that might surprise some of your readers.
