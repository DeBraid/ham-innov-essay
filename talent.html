  Demand for Labour: Local and Global

  Well above average in all categories: http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/toronto-software-engineer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,7_IM976_KO8,25.htm

  Over 350k Canadian live in Bay Area.  Only one in 10 organizations in Canada is able to meet critical IT needs in emerging areas like mobile, cloud computing, analytics and social media, according to a new IBM study. By 2016, we’ll be a full 100,000 tech workers short. http://business.financialpost.com/2013/07/10/why-canada-is-failing-at-tech/?__lsa=7bd0-dc52

  The Information and Communications Technology Council (ICT), an independent policy advisor for the tech sector, has warned of “serious and pervasive” recruitment challenges in the years ahead.  Suggest 106k jobs shortage.  Offer the following solutions: 

  - encourage more post-secondary students to take ICT-related courses, 
  - integrating foreign-educated workers into Canada’s ICT workforce, 
  - shifting post-secondary curriculum towards more cross-disciplinary programs, 
  - getting the industry itself to accept compromises on skill levels 
  - embracing more diversity in the ICT workforce.

  “Employers are on the hunt for personnel who have specific combinations of ICT experience as well as expertise in domains such as e-health, e-finance and digital media. In the next five years, Canada is going to see a new, radically different ICT job market emerge.”

  But fewer than 40,000 American grads earn bachelor’s degrees in computer science. While official figures are hard to come by, that ratio is likely far worse in Canada.

  Meanwhile, Canadian companies are struggling to fill entry-level engineer and developer positions. In a climate of global recession, well paid tech jobs are sitting vacant. Something is deeply wrong with that picture.

  ## Academia and Venture Capital

"why have a professor-in-residence role here at a16z?" 
-- Many of the most successful companies that a16z has been associated with have their foundations in academia.

Yet the process of getting from “bench to bedside” (to borrow a term from academic biomedicine) is hardly a process at all, even at Stanford. 

Smart firms are actively recruiting professors or graduate students in a CS or STEM discipline considering commercializing their research.

Stanford has grown to prominence based on its engineering and medicine and more applied areas.


Stanford Keys: 

1.  Bottom up research design.
2.  Faculty has 1 day per week for non-school business
3.  Student think about entrepenuership from day 1.

Bottom-up allows crazy ideas, or ideas outside the mainstream, which provide a real solution can bubble up much more easily.

At Stanford, faculty can serve 1 day a week at non-Stanford work.  Often this take the form of partnering with start ups, frequently those of former students (the students are day-to-day, the professor’s there one day a week).

Students are always thinking about it as the work is going on, they’re thinking in real time about what would work.

  ## Waterloo & Buffalo

  ## Competition for Talent, Risk and Money

  Back to Waterloo Communitech 

  More than 450 start-ups opened for business in the twin cities of Waterloo and Kitchener last year, more than four times the number begun in 2009. 

  In the year ended April 30, 2013, more than C$214 million ($235 million) was invested in start-ups in the Kitchener-Waterloo area.  Three years earlier, the figure was just $500,000, according to Communitech.

  The Canadian government has also backed C$200 million ($183 million)-plus fund to indirectly invest in and support early and mid-stage start-ups.

  In 1997, Communitech is Waterloo Region’s hub for the commercialization of innovative technologies. Over the years, we have supported and helped build a tech cluster of nearly 1,000 companies that now generates more than $30 billion in revenue.

  Risk capital dives innovation.  Silcon Valley, Toronto, Seattle, Vancouver, Austin, New York, Chicago, and Boston et al have risk capital that flows to ent's.

  Waterloo has risk capital and talent. 

  Y Combinator President/CE) Sam Altman on Waterloo: 
  "We look at it as one of the most important talent pools and sources for startups that we fund".  Described it as one of the few cities in the world they prioritize, and maintain very active presence outside of SV.  It's "such a high-density pool of talent".

  Turned heads with these comments, adding: "I would take the long side of a population-adjusted prop bet that a $10B company emerges from Waterloo before NYC.  Waterloo is the most impressive up-and-coming startup city I've been to."

  Waterloo does not suffer from the same mental block as Hamilton WRT technology.  They have witnessed first hand the impacts of successful start-ups growing into mega-employer and providing jobs and prosperity for entire ecosystem. 

  VC firms consider themselves to be doing well if 4 out of 10 companies they fund succeed.  This type of attitude towards success and failure is not common in society, and especially not in Hamilton where investors overwhelimingly prefer 'safe' securities over 'risky' ones.


  Technology is viewed as the safe bet.  In Hamilton, its eds and meds.  These industries are the last frontiers for technological disruption.  They create the biggest opportunity and thus the greatest challenge for Hamilton.

  Where is the venture capital in Hamilton?  Where is the tech ecosystem?  How can we improve this?

  ## Incentives and Soltions
  -- regular hackathons.  Cash prizes for first, second and third.  Give people with technical skills a chance to come to Hamilton to show off their chops.  Solve big problems that most people investors ignore: like MIT hosting a breast-pump hackathon.  http://www.fastcoexist.com/3035758/a-reinvented-breast-pump-needs-to-be-just-the-first-step-in-changing-pumping-norms

  If we don't give technically skilled people a reason to come to Hamilton (hint: it's money aka jobs, since we all know this is a great livable city!).  If we don't provide capital to start ups then they'll go to Toronto where they have a chance.  Or Buffalo, which recently annouced one of the largest start up competitions ever, with $5million in funding, and a place to work.  Check out http://www.43north.org/about-43north to see how allocating capital to risky ventures can change a rust-belt city.  (43North is part of NY Cuomo’s Buffalo Billion initiative, which is driving new economic opportunities throughout Buffalo and Western New York. http://www.cusli.org/2014Conference/PastConferences/2013Conference/SupportingArticles/tabid/205/FileId/593/Default.aspx )
  Steve Poland has been selected as managing director of Z80 Labs, with $1.5 million in new funding (total $6.6 million) for incubator in Buffalo. www.bizjournals.com/buffalo/news/2015/01/06/z80-taps-poland-as-managing-director-adds-1-5m-in.html

  Hamilton is competing for talent that currently has better opportunities and tech ecosytem in Waterloo, Toronto, and Buffalo.  This is a major challenge for the city, but it has a clear solution:
