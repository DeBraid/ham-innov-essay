# An Essay on Start Ups, Innovation and Technology

## Economic Battle of Rust Belt Cities 

Core thesis, mixture of original and borrowed thoughts that is poorly cited, working on improving this. 

Software eating the world.  Automation + reach.  Never been more furtile environment for science (Steve Jurvetson), software (Marc Andressen) and mobile (Ben Evans).

-------------------
## Why software?
1: mobile browsers are amazing
  -- native devs are expensive, but has value.  it will never die (C++)
  -- near-native is real and provides good UI UX

2: mobile adoption
  -- reach a global audience 
  -- billion of humans who lacked basic non-technical things like running water, toilets, or electricity, or even used a personal computer Windows 95 (the OS / setup that exposed most North Americans to "technology") -- can connect with anyone or any machine on earth via a supercomputer that lives in their pocket.  What we phone as "cell phones" in North America they call "computers" in Africa and Asia!!

## Why rust belt?
1: unique op's: corporate hollowing means that things created from 0 have extraordinary value. 
  -- inverse of structural unemployment 
  -- inverse of structural unemployment 
  
2: software is very easily created from scratch.
  -- costs used to be $100k, even $10k to get the machinery.
  -- now costs are free.  
  -- this goes both ways: 
      -- consumers have cheaper faster computers
      -- developers have tools for browsers and mobile
