# Void

A starter boilerplate app template for [Meteor](http://meteor.com) using [IronRouter](https://github.com/EventedMind/iron-router).

Void is based on [Telescope](http://telesc.pe) (an open-source social news app) and is bought to you by the [Discover Meteor](https://www.discovermeteor.com) team. 

## Installation

If you already have Meteor and [Meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite/), Void is ready to go. Just clone it locally, run it with `mrt`, and start coding!

If not, here are the full instructions:

```
curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh
npm install -g meteorite
git clone https://github.com/SachaG/Void.git myApp
cd myApp
mrt
```

## Features

- Client-side routing
- Publications/subscriptions
- Basic permissions
- Common templates

## Principles

Void adopts a modular approach, where code is broken down in different files rather than all kept in one place. It also uses the “template/mapper” pattern, where the `item.html` template has a similarly named `item.js` JavaScript file that holds its helper code.

Void uses the `Items` collection as an example, but you would probably replace this with your own collection name (`Posts`, `Sales`, `Projects`, etc.) and change the file and variables names accordingly.
